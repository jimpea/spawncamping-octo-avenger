Learning how to use Node.js and Git. Not interesting! Here is a quick cheat sheet of git commands:

- `git commit -m "message"` - commits staged files
- `git commit -a -m "message"` - commits all files and skips the staging, no need for `git add`.
- `git status` - list modified files
- `git add` - stage a file
- `git diff` - list unstaged changes. On my box gets me into vim (help!). Type 'q' to exit this monstrosity.
- `git diff --cached` - list staged changed
